# Build Stage
#
# This stage installs all dependencies (including dev), builds the TypeScript
# source code into JavaScript, and prepares the production assets.
#
# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM rather than the target platform: `bun run build` emits
# JavaScript, and only `dist/` crosses into the production stage. Built for the
# target instead, the non-native leg of a `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
# build runs under QEMU, where bun >= 1.4 aborts with a JavaScriptCore allocator
# assertion and fails the multi-arch push.
#
# The constraint this assumes: the build stage produces platform-independent
# output. A stage that compiles a native addon needs the target-arch toolchain
# and cannot cross-compile this way — drop the flag there.

# Production Dependencies Stage

# Installs the production dependency tree for the target platform. Every step
# here can run JavaScript — bunfig.toml's security scanner runs as a Bun
# program, and so do the OTel and musl-prune scripts — so the stage runs on
# $BUILDPLATFORM and cross-installs with `--os`/`--cpu`, which pick each
# platform-specific optional dependency (native bindings such as DuckDB's) for
# the target. Only `node_modules` leaves this stage.
#
# A clean image rather than `FROM build`: the build stage's node_modules holds
# devDependencies.

# `--os`/`--cpu` have no libc counterpart, so a native dependency published in

# runtime image is Debian (glibc) and never loads the musl copy; the script
# deletes every package whose own `libc` admits only musl. It follows every
# install, since a later `bun install` restores what it removes. A server on a
# musl (Alpine) runtime image drops these two lines.
